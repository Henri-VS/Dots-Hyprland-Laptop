# Dots-Hyprland-Laptop

---

Hi
This repository is my personal dotfiles for an **Fedora Linux** system running the **Hyprland**. These configurations are made to my specific workflow and preferences, offering a basic yet functional setup.

---


This repository contains the following configurations:

* **Hyprland:** The Wayland compositor itself, handling window management and more.
* **Waybar:** A customizable Wayland bar for displaying system information.
* **Rofi:** A application launcher.
* **Kitty:** The best terminal.

### Important Notes

* **Tailored to my needs:** These dotfiles reflect my personal preferences and may not be suitable for everyone out of the box. You will likely need to adjust paths, keybindings, and other settings to match your system and preferences.
* **Basic setup:** This configuration provides a foundational Hyprland environment.
* **Fedora Linux specific:** These dotfiles are primarily designed for Fedora Linux and its package management.
* **Feel free to fork**
